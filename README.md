# Welcome to the "Calculator In Every Language" project.
> Almost every language
---
## This an endevor is to unite all four corners of the programming world into *one-simple-concept*. The <b>Calculator</b>.

Any calculator would not suffice.
Each version[^1] of a language should be able to access the calculator by instantiating the calculator class and calling the `Main` function[^2] or the `CalculatorProgram` function[^2], eg
```
class Calculator:
	# some code...

calculator = Calculator()
calculator.Main()
```
---
#### The goal of each language is to be able to complete the following:
- [ ] Arithmetic opperations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
- [ ] Powers, Roots
- [ ] Unit conversions
- [ ] Normal algebraic expressions
---
#### Currently implemented languages:
- Python
- C#

#### Next set of languages:
- C++
- Java

[^1]: A version is a modification or variation to the previous implementation.
[^2]: A function could also be a method or anything else that runs some code with an identifier.
